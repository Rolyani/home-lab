# Kubernetes Homelab
## Overview
This repository documents the configuration and setup of a personal Kubernetes homelab environment. The homelab is intended for experimentation, testing, and learning purposes. It provides a safe, isolated space to trial new tools, deployment strategies, and infrastructure concepts without impacting production systems.

## Purpose
The primary aim of this homelab is to:

Explore Kubernetes features and best practices.

Test and validate containerised applications and microservices.

Trial infrastructure-as-code tools, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment workflows.

Experiment with monitoring, logging, and security tooling.

Gain hands-on experience with modern DevOps and cloud-native technologies.

## Important Notes
This homelab is not designed for production use.

Data and configurations within the cluster may be volatile and subject to change without notice.

Security hardening has been applied where reasonable, but the environment remains intended for personal, non-commercial use within a controlled network.

## Environment
The homelab runs on physical and virtual machines within a private local network. Core components include:

Kubernetes (k3s) for lightweight cluster management.

Flux CD for GitOps-based continuous delivery.

Docker for container builds.

Various open source tools for monitoring, networking, and storage management.

## Disclaimer
This setup is a personal project for educational and professional development. Use of any configurations, scripts, or deployments from this repository is at your own risk.
